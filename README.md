Voop is meant to be simple and lightweight videoart tool.

It can sync [relatively short] video clips with running music software via Ableton Link.

If you want to check what Voop can do you should run it with a path to your video

```
go run . --folder="folder/with/your/videos"
```

it requires running [Carabiner](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/carabiner) on 127.0.0.1:17000

and opencv installed locally

on mac it usually can be done with brew
```
brew install opencv
```
